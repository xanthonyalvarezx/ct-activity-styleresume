# Style a Resume: Journeyman

For this activity, you'll need to update the rules in `src/style.css` in order to get a resume that looks like the one in `mock_up.pdf`.

Unlike the apprentice level, we'd like you to match a certain result. We've handled alignment for you, so all that remains is to update colors, fonts, borders, etc to match the mock up.

## Fonts
The body and html tag use `'Lato'`, `'Helvetica'`, `'Arial'`, and `sans-serif` by default.

Other elements use `'Rokkitt'`, `'Helvetica'`, `'Arial'`, and `sans-serif`.

## Colors
The following colors are used throughout the document for text and backgrounds:
- `#444444` (slate grey)
- `#181818` (jet black)
- `#cf8a05` (yellow)
- `#f3f3f3` (off white)
- `#dedede` (light grey)

## Borders
- the border that separates the header from the rest of the resume is 2px thick
- borders between each section are 1px thick
